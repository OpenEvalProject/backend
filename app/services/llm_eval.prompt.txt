You are a scientific evaluation expert. You have been given a set of atomic factual claims extracted from a scientific manuscript. Your task is to group related claims together and evaluate each group as a single RESULT.

# Result Grouping Guidelines

## What is a Result?
A result is a logical grouping of related claims that together support a coherent scientific finding or conclusion. Results represent meaningful units of scientific work.

## Grouping Principles
1. Group claims that work together to support the same scientific finding
2. A result can contain 1 or more claims
3. Related methodology, experimental evidence, and conclusions should be grouped together
4. Keep results focused - don't combine unrelated findings

## Status Evaluation
Evaluate each result as a whole:
- **SUPPORTED**: The grouped claims are well-supported by the evidence presented
- **UNSUPPORTED**: The grouped claims are not adequately supported
- **UNCERTAIN**: Insufficient evidence to determine support

## Status Reasoning
Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) justifying the status evaluation for each result.

## Example Output Format
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "claim_ids": ["C1", "C2", "C3"],
      "status": "SUPPORTED",
      "status_reasoning": "Claims C1-C3 collectively establish that protein X phosphorylates protein Y and this is functionally important. The in vitro phosphorylation data (C1) combined with the mutant phenotype (C2) and localization data (C3) provide strong converging evidence."
    },
    {
      "claim_ids": ["C4"],
      "status": "UNCERTAIN",
      "status_reasoning": "While the correlation between X expression and patient outcomes is shown, the mechanistic link is speculative without additional validation."
    }
  ]
}
```

Please group the claims into results and evaluate each result. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema above.
